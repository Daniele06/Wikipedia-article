                        was
                        a

                        undertaken in Australia over the latter part of 1932 to address public concern over the number
                        of <a href="">emus</a>
                        said to be running amok in the <a href="">Campion</a> district of <a href="">Western

                        The
                        unsuccessful attempts to curb
                        the population of emus, a large <a href="">flightless bird</a> indigenous to Australia, employed
                        soldiers armed with
                        <a href="">Lewis</a> guns—leading the media to adopt the name "Emu War" when referring to the
                        incident.
                        While a number
                        of the birds were killed, the emu population persisted and continued to cause crop destruction.

                </div>
                <p>Following <a href="">World War I</a>, large numbers of <a href="">discharged veterans</a> who served
                    in
                    the war were given land by the
                    Australian government to take up farming within Western Australia, often in agriculturally marginal
                    areas. With the onset of the <a href="">Great Depression</a> in 1929, these farmers were encouraged
                    to
                    increase their
                    <a href="">wheat</a> crops, with the government promising—and failing to deliver—assistance in the
                    form
                    of subsidies.
                    In spite of the recommendations and the promised <a href="">subsidies</a>, wheat prices continued to
                    fall, and by
                    October 1932 matters were becoming intense, with the farmers preparing to harvest the season's crop
                    while simultaneously threatening to refuse to deliver the wheat.<a href=""
                        class="references">[2]</a>

                    The difficulties facing farmers were increased by the arrival of as many as 20,000 emus.<a href=""
                        class="references">[3]</a> Emus
                    regularly migrate after their breeding season, heading to the coast from the inland regions. With
                    the
                    cleared land and additional water supplies being made available for livestock by the Western
                    Australian
                    farmers, the emus found that the cultivated lands were good habitat, and they began to foray into
                    farm
                    territory—in particular the marginal farming land around <a href="">Chandler</a> and <a
                        href="">Walgoolan</a>.<a href="" class="references">[2]</a> The emus consumed
                    and spoiled the crops, as well as leaving large gaps in fences where rabbits could enter and <a
                        href="">cause
                        further problems</a>.<a href="" class="references">[4]</a>

                    Farmers relayed their concerns about the birds ravaging their crops, and a deputation of ex-soldiers
                    were sent to meet with the <a href="">Minister of Defence</a>, Sir <a href="">George Pearce</a>.
                    Having
                    served in World War I, the
                    soldier-settlers were well aware of the effectiveness of machine guns, and they requested their
                    deployment. The minister readily agreed, although with conditions attached: the guns were to be used
                    by
                    military personnel, troop transport was to be financed by the Western Australian government, and the
                    farmers would provide food, accommodation, and payment for the ammunition.<a href="">[2]</a><a
                        href="" class="references">[5]</a> Pearce also supported
                    the deployment on the grounds that the birds would make good target practice,<a href=""
                        class="references">[6]</a>
                    while it
                    has also been
                    argued that some in the government may have viewed the operation as a way of being seen to be
                    helping
                    the Western Australian farmers, to stave off <a href="">the secession movement</a> that was brewing.
                    Towards that end,
                    a <a href="">cinematographer</a> from <a href="">Fox Movietone</a> was enlisted.<a href=""

            <p>Military involvement was due to begin in October 1932.<a href="" class="references">[5]</a> The "war" was

                under
                the
                command of Major
                G. P. W. Meredith of the Seventh Heavy Battery of the <a href="">Royal Australian Artillery</a>,</p>
            <a href="" class="references">[2]</a><a href="" class="references">[6]</a> with Meredith
            commanding soldiers Sergeant S. McMurray and Gunner J. O'Halloran,<a href="" class="references">[8]</a>
            armed with two <a href="">Lewis
                guns</a><a href="" class="references">[9]</a> and
            10,000 rounds of ammunition.<a href="" class="references">[6]</a> The operation was delayed, however, by a
            period of
            rainfall
            that caused the
            emus to scatter over a wider area.<a href="" class="references">[5]</a> The rain ceased by 2 November
            1932,<a href="" class="references">[2]</a><a href="" class="references">[5]</a> whereupon the troops were
            deployed with orders to assist the farmers and, according to a newspaper account, to collect 100 emu
            skins
            so that their feathers could be used to make hats for <a href="">light horsemen</a>.<a href=""
                class="references">[10]</a>

            <h2>First attempt</h2>

            On 2 November the men travelled to <a href="">Campion</a>, where some 50 emus were sighted.<a href=""
                class="references">[2]</a> As the
            birds
            were out of
            range of the guns, the local settlers attempted to herd the emus into an ambush, but the birds split
            into
            small groups and ran so that they were difficult to target.<a href="" class="references">[6]</a>
            Nevertheless, while the first
            fusillade
            from
            the machine guns was ineffective due to the range, a second round of gunfire was able to kill "a number"
            of
            birds. Later the same day a small flock was encountered, and "perhaps a dozen" birds were killed.<a href=""

            The next significant event was on 4 November. Meredith had established an <a href="">ambush</a> near a
            local
            dam, and more
            than 1,000 emus were spotted heading towards their position. This time the gunners waited until the
            birds
            were in close proximity before opening fire. The gun jammed after only twelve birds were killed and the
            remainder scattered before any more could be shot.<a href="" class="references">[8]</a> No more birds were
            sighted that day.<a href="" class="references">[2]</a><br><br>

            In the days that followed, Meredith chose to move further south, where the birds were "reported to be
            fairly
            tame",<a href="" class="references">[11]</a> but there was only limited success in spite of his efforts.<a
                href="" class="references">[2]</a> By
            the fourth day of the
            campaign,
            army observers noted that "each pack seems to have its own leader now—a big black-plumed bird which
            stands
            fully six feet high and keeps watch while his mates carry out their work of destruction and warns them
            of
            our approach".<a href="" class="references">[12]</a> At one stage Meredith even went so far as to mount one
            of the guns on a
            truck, a move
            that proved to be ineffective, as the truck was unable to gain on the birds, and the ride was so rough
            that
            the gunner was unable to fire any shots.<a href="" class="references">[2]</a> By 8 November, six days after
            the first
            engagement, 2,500
            rounds
            of ammunition had been fired.<a href="" class="references">[6]</a> The number of birds killed is uncertain:
            one account
            estimates that it
            was
            50 birds,<a href="" class="references">[6]</a> but other accounts range from 200 to 500, the latter figure
            being provided by
            the settlers.
            Meredith's official report noted that his men had suffered no casualties.<a href=""
                class="references">[2]</a><br><br>

            Summarising the culls, ornithologist <a href="">Dominic Serventy</a> commented:<br><br>

            <div style="margin-left: 50px;">The machine-gunners' dreams of point blank fire into serried masses of Emus
                were soon dissipated. The
                Emu
                command had evidently ordered guerrilla tactics, and its unwieldy army soon split up into innumerable
                small
                units that made use of the military equipment uneconomic. A crestfallen field force therefore withdrew
                from
                the combat area after about a month.<a href="" class="references">[13]</a></div><br>

            On 8 November, members in the <a href="">Australian House of Representatives</a> discussed the
            operation.<a href="" class="references">[6]</a>
            Following the
            negative coverage of the events in the local media,<a href="" class="references">[14]</a> that included
            claims that "only a
            few" emus had
            died,<a href="" class="references">[4]</a> Pearce withdrew the military personnel and the guns on 8
            November.<a href="">[4]</a><a href="" class="references">[6]</a><a href="" class="references">[15]</a><a
                href="" class="references">[16]</a><br><br>

            After the withdrawal, Major Meredith compared the emus to <a href="">Zulus</a> and commented on the
            striking
            manoeuvrability of the emus, even while badly wounded.<br><br>

            <div style="margin-left: 50px;">If we had a military division with the bullet-carrying capacity of these
                birds it would face any army in
                the
                world ... They can face machine guns with the invulnerability of tanks. They are like Zulus whom even
                <a href="">dum-dum bullets</a> could not stop.<a href="" class="references">[12]</a></div><br>

            <h2>Second attempt</h2>

            After the withdrawal of the military, the emu attacks on crops continued. Farmers again asked for
            support,
            citing the hot weather and drought that brought emus invading farms in the thousands. <a href="">James
                Mitchell</a>, the
            <a href="">Premier of Western Australia</a> lent his strong support to renewal of the military
            assistance.
            At the same
            time, a report from the Base Commander was issued that indicated 300 emus had been killed in the initial
            operation.<a href="" class="references">[16]</a><br><br>

            Acting on the requests and the Base Commander's report, by 12 November the Minister of Defence approved
            a
            resumption of military efforts.<a href="" class="references">[16]</a> He defended the decision in the
            Senate, explaining
            why
            the soldiers were
            necessary to combat the serious agricultural threat of the large emu population.<a href=""
                class="references">[4]</a>
            Although
            the military
            had agreed to lend the guns to the Western Australian government on the expectation that they would
            provide
            the necessary people, Meredith was once again placed in the field due to an apparent lack of experienced
            machine gunners in the state.<a href="" class="references">[2]</a><br><br>

            Taking to the field on 13 November 1932, the military found a degree of success over the first two days,
            with approximately 40 emus killed. The third day, 15 November, proved to be far less successful, but by
            2
            December the soldiers were killing approximately 100 emus per week. Meredith was recalled on 10
            December,
            and in his report he claimed 986 kills with 9,860 rounds, at a rate of exactly 10 rounds per confirmed
            kill.
            In addition, Meredith claimed 2,500 wounded birds had died as a result of the injuries that they had
            sustained.<a href="" class="references">[2]</a> In assessing the success of the cull, an article in the
            Coolgardie Miner on
            23
            August 1935
            reported that although the use of machine guns had been "criticised in many quarters, the method proved
            effective and saved what remained of the wheat".<a href="" class="references">[17]</a>

            <h3>Aftermath</h3>
            <div class="medium-separator"></div>

            Despite the problems encountered with the cull, the farmers of the region once again requested military
            assistance in 1934, 1943, and 1948, only to be turned down by the government.<a href="">[2]</a><a href=""
                class="references">[18]</a> Instead, the bounty
            system that had been instigated in 1923 was continued, and this proved to be effective: 57,034 bounties
            were
            claimed over a six-month period in 1934.<a href="" class="references">[6]</a><br><br>

            By December 1932, word of the Emu War had spread, reaching the <a href="">United Kingdom</a>. Some
            conservationists there
            protested the cull as "extermination of the rare emu".<a href="" class="references">[19]</a> <a
                href="">Dominic
                Serventy</a>
            and <a href="">Hubert Whittell</a>, the eminent
            Australian ornithologists, described the "war" as "an attempt at the mass destruction of the
            birds".<a href="" class="references">[20]</a><a href="" class="references">[21]</a><a href=""
                class="references">[22]</a><br><br>

            Throughout 1930 and onward, <a href="">exclusion barrier fencing</a> became a popular means of keeping
            emus
            out of
            agricultural areas (in addition to other vermin, such as <a href="">dingoes</a> and <a
                href="">rabbits</a>).<a href="" class="references">[23]</a><a href=""
                class="references">[12]</a><br><br>

            In November 1950, <a href="">Hugh Leslie</a> raised the issues of emus in federal parliament and urged
            Army
            Minister <a href="">Josiah
                Francis</a> to release a quantity of .303 ammunition from the army for the use of farmers. The
            minister
            approved
            the release of 500,000 rounds of ammunition.<a href="" class="references">[24]</a><br><br>

            In recent years, references to the Emu War have been a popular <a href="">Internet meme</a>.<a href=""
                class="references">[25]</a><a href="" class="references">[26]</a> In 2020 it inspired a
            video game entitled <i>Emu War!</i>.<a href="" class="references">[27]</a><br><br>
